        We want the number of shortest paths from node 0 to node n-1.
        
        Approach:
        1. Build an adjacency list for the graph.
        2. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest distances from 0 to every node.
        3. Maintain a 'ways' array where ways[i] = number of ways to reach node i 
           via a shortest path.
        4. If we find a strictly shorter path to a node v via u, we update dist[v] 
           and set ways[v] = ways[u].
        5. If we find another path with the same distance, we add ways[u] to ways[v].
        6. The result is ways[n-1] % (10^9 + 7).
